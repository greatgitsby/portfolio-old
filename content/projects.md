The following is a collection of projects I have worked on in the past for both university, current, and past jobs. Any source code that is publicly available can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/greatgitsby).

## GFU EPIC Website

[Link to site](https://gfuprojects.com)

This website is for my Servant Engineering project during my third year at Fox. We created a workflow and set of resources for teachers at a local high school to submit project ideas and have us create what they had envisioned. The source is located [here](https://github.com/greatgitsby/gfu-project-site).

## Simple Monitors - Client Dashboard

I built a dashboard for Simple Monitors clients to manage their webhook configurations, authentication, and release channels. It leverages HTML/CSS/jQuery and is served by a simple Node.js application and it runs on a simple Heroku configuration. 

## Simple Monitors - Admin Dashboard

I built a dashboard for internal management of sites and products monitored by our web scraping platform. Each site 'platform' has a dedicated page to display its active configurations and perform C.R.U.D. operations 

## Simple Monitors - Web Scraper Platform 

The management dashboard would hold very little value without the scraping platform itself. I created a fully distributed scraping platform to monitor product additions and restocks. The platform is backed by a Kubernetes cluster and leverages technologies like Redis, an MPI-like layer on top of Redis, and various Node.js microservices. 

## Simple Monitors - Database REST API
